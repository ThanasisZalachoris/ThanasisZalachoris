## 🧠 About Me  

I’m a data-driven problem solver with a multidisciplinary academic background and a strong focus on **analytics, business intelligence, and urban-tourism innovation**.  
Currently developing **Tourism Strain Index (TSI)**, an original MVP that captures overtourism indicators for regional planning.

My skillset combines **machine learning**, **data storytelling**, and **real-world applications** using tools like Python, Power BI, and Streamlit.

Always seeking ways to bridge data with decision-making – one dashboard, one model at a time.
